This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Statistics and Economics.
- I am taking STATS 220 because when choosing my subjects for this year, this course seemed to be one of the more interesting courses for stats. So, we shall see...
- I am interested in learning about just stats in general. For some strange reasons I have loved studying stats since year 12 in high school.
