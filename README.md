This is my repo for **STATS 220**

## A Little About Me
- I am undertaking a degree in *Statistics and Economics*.
- I am taking STATS 220 because when I was choosing my subjects for this year, reading about this course seemed to be one of the more interesting courses for stats. Through the first week I seem to have choosen correctly. So, we shall see in a couple weeks...
- I am interested in learning about stats in general as ever since 2022 Year 12 high school stats I have *loved* studying stats.
